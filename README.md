# Computer-Vision-ITAI-1378

## 📌 Lab 01 Overview

This project explores Facial Detection and Facial Recognition as a biometric system using principles of computer vision and deep learning. The goal is to understand how facial recognition systems work, their real-world applications, and the ethical challenges surrounding their use.
This lab focuses primarily on face detection and recognition concepts, explaining the pipeline, benefits, limitations, and societal impact of the technology.

## 📌 Lab 02 Overview

This Google Colab laboratory provides a hands-on exploration of fundamental digital image processing concepts. Participants will gain a deep understanding of how images are represented computationally, implement core image manipulation techniques, and connect these traditional methods to the underlying principles of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools like Google's Nano Banana.

## 📌 Lab 03 Overview

Traditional machine learning models, especially in computer vision, often struggle with generalization when faced with limited data and variations in real-world scenarios. A common pitfall is overfitting, where models achieve high accuracy on training data but fail on new, unseen data. This project aims to demonstrate the complete classical machine learning pipeline for computer vision, highlighting the critical importance of proper training approaches to build models that generalize effectively, rather than merely memorizing training examples.

## 📌 Lab 04 Overview

This project aims to build a neural network classifier to distinguish between images of muffins and chihuahuas. 

## 📌 Lab 05 Overview

This project aims to accurately classify images as either a "Chihuahua" or a "Muffin" using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It builds upon previous work that utilized traditional Neural Networks, demonstrating the enhanced capabilities of CNNs for image classification tasks.

## 📌 Lab 06 Overview

Traditional image classification can tell us what is in an image (e.g., "This is a cat 🐱"), but it doesn't tell us where the objects are located within the image. Object detection aims to solve this by not only identifying objects but also localizing them with precise bounding boxes. This is crucial for applications where spatial information is vital, such as self-driving cars 🚗, surveillance systems 📹, and medical imaging 🩺.

## 📌 Lab 08 Overview

Visual Language Models (VLMs) are at the forefront of AI, enabling machines to understand and reason across both images and text. This lab aims to provide a hands-on exploration into the world of VLMs, focusing on their core architectures, diverse applications, and critical evaluation methods. The primary challenge addressed is to demystify how these complex models bridge the gap between human language and visual perception, and to equip learners with the practical skills to implement, evaluate, and critically analyze VLM capabilities and limitations.

## 📌 Midterm & Final Project Overview

This project combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with deep learning and a geometric packing algorithm to estimate the number of potential buildable lots within a given plot boundary. The system processes survey plat images to extract dimensions, calculates theoretical lot placements, and uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify image characteristics, ultimately providing a comprehensive lot prediction.
